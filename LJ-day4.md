CODE 201: Day 4 

Theme Music: “I’m So Excited” – Le Tigre

Second journal entry.  Do day is a lab day. Just completed my day 3 journal and now working on day 4. Will try to do the repository/github portion of this assignment right after this but probably won’t have time before my lunch ends.  The journaling is definitely calming even though the work is starting to pile up.  I have to complete the reading & reading assignment from yesterday still, get these journals posted and start on my Lab 2. It is really comforting though to know that only the Labs need to be submitted by due date/time for full points, hopefully this will not allow my subconscious to slack of on the journals and reading. 
Lab 2 is called “_About Me_” has code that is very similar to Lab one (prompts, questions, console.log, if/else statements, variables) but with a few extra’s. We will be using **.toUpperCase()** which makes any input upper case and **.toLowerCase()** which makes all input lower case.  I think the biggest learning bit of this assignment is all the GitHub stuff, creating the repositories, committing and figuring out how to find them and open them in the terminal. **ACP – Add, Commit, Push.** 

Goals for tonight’s Lab Class: 
1.	Ask one of the TA’s to help me figure out how to organize my directories correctly and where I should be saving things. 
2.	Create the repository for my Journal and commit my current entries. 
3.	Figure out my questions and write out the pseudo code for my About Me Lab
4.	Start on the code.
_Bonne Chance!_
