We are midway through week 6 of 8.  Gearing up for Project time.  Went to a great meetup yesterday to fullfill the meetup assigment.  The subject was "Targeting a Career Change in Web Development" and the presenter and the panel were all really great, open and informative. Interesting backgrounds in the industry with lots of great insights on tips and resources. 

I still have to fix my BusMall Lab 10 and start on Lab 11; this week has been super busy at work and outside of work and today focusing was really hard. That was my high school on the news today where 17 some kids were shot.... so not able to do much during lunch break other catch up with friends and family that also graduated there and/or still live in the area. Everyone that I know and friends of friends are all okay so that's a blessing and all anyone can ask for in this crazy world we live in.
