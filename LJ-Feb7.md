Dear Journal,

Today I met a boy.. just kidding.  Week 5 is flying by.  I have completed the Wireframing exercise which was not terribly difficult but that was mostly due to the very thorough class code demo on it.  The Chocolate Pizza lab will be another story.   I feel like there should probably be a 8 week course on just HTML and CSS minus the JavaScript.  Life would be so much easier that way.   I've never felt more like a millennial than when I'm looking at the CSS code for a button and thinking "can it actually, really take THAT much code to make it look like THAT!!!!".   But I guess that's why they pay us the big bucks right... well the people doing this job, not me, not yet anyways. 

I'm still carrying a massive burden of over due reading assignments. One day I'll catch up... maybe.
