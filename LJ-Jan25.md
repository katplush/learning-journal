Just over the hump of week 3.  Salmon Cookies is in its infancy stage and feeling good so far I’m pretty comfortable with what is expected and what needs to be done... but I always sway optimistic and underestimate the time something will take. Anyways I have 2 nights and all of Saturday to submit Lab 6 & 7 and with the class demo and lecture code I’m really crossing my fingers that I’ll be in better shape than I was last Saturday night. 
This week so far has been about object literals, the DOM and constructor functions.  I feel pretty comfortable with the Object Literals, and maybe DOM … not entirely sure about constructor functions till I start trying to formulate my own tonight.  

In general, week three is going well.  Outlook is positive.
