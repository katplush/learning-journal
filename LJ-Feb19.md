I think this is week 7. I just finished my 301 Entrance Exam and scored an 83%. Definitely thought I would have done better.  Got stumpted on both prototype questions and a few other things. Was able to submit all my other past due readings last night and a couple of the career assignments so that is all a relief. 

We chose our project teams last week and I'll be working on Pastry Punk with Josh, Haley and Rosie. They all seem like awesome people and I think it will be really fun to work on a project based around something we all seem to be quite passionate about.
