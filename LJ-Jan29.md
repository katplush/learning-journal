Today marks the beginning of week 4 and week two of Salmon Cookies.  I managed to fit in some time to relax and clean and catch-up on life this weekend but definitely behind on reading assignments. Hoping to catch up on my lunch breaks this week.  I managed alright on Lab 6 with the object literals and css for the main page and was working till midnight on Saturday to figure out that table.  I got the header and I believe I'm pretty close with the code for the rest of it but just didn't have enough time to mess around with any more.  I'm still trying to wrap my head around what the DOM is and how it intersects with everything we've done so far and still trying to figure out the different ways of calling or executing the multiple functions we are working with. Anyways it will definitely be helpful to go through the table making code today in class to make sure I'm going in the right direction with my code.
