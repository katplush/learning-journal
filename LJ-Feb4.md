Week 5 is beginning tomorrow.  Turned in Salmon Cookies last night.  Not necessarily happy with how it looks but I think I met all the necessary requirements and the JS code works so I guess that’s good. Salmon Cookies was good project that exposed us to a lot of different components.  Constructor functions, tables, forms, accessing the DOM and refining CSS code.   I wish I could say that after this that I had a good grasp of all these concepts but at least I have a good project to go back to and enhance with additional self-study on the individual concepts.

Lots of reading to catch up on before the week begins so that’s all for now.
