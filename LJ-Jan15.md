Week 1 has ended and week 2 starts tomorrow. I can definitely say I needed the two days we got due to MLK Day to recover from it. 

To recap week 1 end of week one, we've started to dabble in git branches, loops, arrays, a booleans, box models.  I think I have a pretty good handle on the terminal and my code editor and the relationship and role of GitHub and how to properly us it. I really struggled with the nested loops and boolean variables necessary for Lab 3 but I think I was able to gain more understanding on how and why with some self-study over the weekend. 

In general I'm mostly happy with how it went, I've definitely learned a lot.  A good portion of that being more so how to better handle this coming week. Some goals:
- ask more questions of the TAs and or our Slack channel (stick to the 15 minute rule; realized I definitely did not do that this week)
- do a better job searching the web for what I'm stuck on (this week I really struggled finding the info I needed and now I realize that my searches were too vague)
- try to do better at staying on top of the reading; watch more YouTube videos on loops, arrays, booleans, functions to see more examples of problems being solved
