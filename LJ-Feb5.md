Up and running in week 5!!! We are over the hump... well maybe that doesn't actually apply here.  I got through a bit of my reading assignment build up last night but it keeps building up!!! In the works for this week - wireframe exercise and a pair programing timed lab called Chocolate Pizza.  Haven't started on either yet but hopefully will be able to make some good headway tomorrow during lab.  

Found a good meetup to go to during cowork on Thursday, Seattle JS.  Great group, been to a few of their meetups in the past.  It will be really cool too actually recognize some of the lingo this time.  So that's exciting.  Have to start thinking of final project ideas.  Have nothing yet and that will take some good brain storming time. Alrighty that's a wrap for today!
