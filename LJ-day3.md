CODE 201: Day 3

First journal entry for this course. Survived day 3.  To back track a little to the beginning, day 1 was nice and easy mostly introductions.  Day 2 was computer set up, a short lecture and a demo on prompts with a lab requiring code using four JavaScript Prompt statements asking and answering questions about ourselves.  The alerts needed to concatenate the responses into one string in the end as well as use **console.log** to indicate the nature of the question and the user’s answer in the console.  This not a necessarily difficult lab but being the very first one took me almost 3hrs to complete due to a small panic attack and creativity brain block.  But once I came up with questions/outline things flowed much more smoothly and I learned that writing out **pseudo code** would help with the writer’s block when actually getting to the code. I completed lab one was very happy of the results and got a 10 out of 10. Yay for me! 

Day 3 was a bit easier due to it mostly being lecture.  Continued to have struggles following along with the navigating and directory making in the terminal.  A little lost on how many directories I’m supposed to have and were they are all supposed to be and were I should be placing all the repositories I’m creating and so on. We were shown an new demo, fairly similar to the first and given our next Lab assignment due on Saturday morning. 

A few struggles that are worth mentioning: 

1.	I’m working a windows device, while 75% of class and the teacher are on MAC.  This is making it more difficult to follow along.  And I and a few of the other window users are finding out that there are different commands that we need to use in our bash terminals... which aren’t necessarily apparent during the demos/lectures. 
2.	I have very little to no time between waking up, work, class then sleep to complete homework assignments and I will definitely be sleep deprived for the next 8 weeks.  Unfortunately, with my schedule there is nothing I can do about this but stay cool and keep reminding myself why I need to do this.  And yes I need to do this.
